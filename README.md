# Network Traffic Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning

## Executive Summary

This project explores the use of machine learning to detect anomalies in network traffic â€” particularly malicious behavior such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Using the CICIDS 2017 dataset, the project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and develops a baseline logistic regression model to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic. The initial model achieves near-perfect accuracy, forming a strong foundation for further model enhancement and eventual real-time deployment.

## Rationale

In todayâ€™s hyper-connected world, even home and small business networks face persistent security threats. Most users have no visibility into whatâ€™s happening in their network traffic until it's too late. This project addresses that gap by applying machine learning techniques to identify abnormal activity in network logs â€” potentially helping detect threats like botnets, scanning, infiltration, and brute-force attempts before damage occurs.

## Research Question

**Can we detect anomalies in network traffic that may indicate suspicious or malicious activity using machine learning models trained on historical traffic patterns?**

## Data Sources

- **Primary dataset**: CICIDS 2017 (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity)  
  - [Link to dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)  
  - Focused on `Friday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-DDos.pcap_ISCX.csv`, which includes both benign and DDoS traffic.
- Future plan: augment with **live network traffic** from a home network using tools like Zeek and Wireshark.

## Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaning missing and infinite values.
  - Removing features with extreme magnitudes or constant values.
  - Encoding labels and scaling numeric features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Correlation heatmaps.
  - Feature distributions and boxplots by traffic type.
- **Baseline Modeling**:
  - Logistic Regression to classify benign vs. attack traffic.
  - Model evaluation using classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC AUC.

## Results

| Metric        | Result     |
|---------------|------------|
| Accuracy      | 99.85%     |
| Precision     | 1.00       |
| Recall        | 1.00       |
| F1-Score      | 1.00       |
| ROC AUC Score | 0.9998     |

- Logistic Regression achieved near-perfect separation between benign and DDoS traffic.
- Confusion matrix showed only 67 misclassifications out of 45,000+ samples.
- Correlation analysis revealed redundant and highly correlated features, which were removed for clarity and model stability.

## Next Steps

- Implement additional models (Random Forest, Isolation Forest, Autoencoder).
- Explore unsupervised anomaly detection for unlabeled traffic.
- Perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- Set up real-time data pipeline using Zeek or Wireshark.
- Deploy the model using Docker + AWS and create a web-based dashboard or Slack alert integration.
